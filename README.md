# AqueraWars  [Website](https://aquera-wars.vercel.app/):


## Project Overview
AqueraWars is a web application that serves as a comprehensive directory for planets from the Star Wars universe. It leverages the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch and display detailed information about each planet, including its name, climate, population, and terrain. Additionally, the application provides a list of notable residents for each planet, showcasing their name, height, mass, and gender.

## Motivation
The Star Wars Planets Directory is a web application that provides detailed information about planets from the Star Wars universe. Utilizing the Star Wars API (SWAPI), this application fetches and displays data for each planet, including its name, climate, population, terrain, and notable residents. The project demonstrates proficiency in API integration, frontend development, and a responsive user interface design.


## Functionalities
1. **Planets Directory**: Fetches and displays information about planets from the SWAPI, presenting each planet's data in a distinct card.

2. **Profile Section**: Provides a list of residents for each planet, including details such as name, height, mass, and gender.
3. **Pagination Mechanism**: Implements pagination functionality to navigate through the list of planets, making use of the "next" URL provided in the API's response for fetching additional pages.
4. **Styling and Responsiveness**: Utilizes CSS for styling, focusing on clean, engaging layout design and ensuring a responsive user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
   
## Tech Stack
- **React.js**: For building a React-based web app.
- **Redux, Redux Toolkit**: For state management and handling complex application logic.
- **react-router-dom**: For routing to different pages
- **Star Wars API**: Used to fetch details about planets and residents.
- **Native CSS**: Ensures a responsive and mobile-friendly UI.

## Unique Aspects
This project stands out due to its integration of the SWAPI, which provides detailed information about the Star Wars universe. The use of the Redux Toolkit ensures efficient state management, while the implementation of pagination enhances user experience.

## Future Improvements
1. **Search**: Implement search functionality to allow users to search for specific planets or residents.
2. **Optimized UI/UX**: Continuously refine and optimize the UI for an improved user experience.
3. **Error Handling**: Strengthen error handling and provide informative error messages.
